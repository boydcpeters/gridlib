Introduction
============

In the following sections, we introduce the analyses that can be performed with this
package and we provide examples to explain how these analyses can be performed. If you
decide to perform the analyses introduced here then we would recommend you to read the
following paper:

Reisser, M., Hettich, J., Kuhn, T., Popp, A.P., Gro√üe-Berkenbusch, A. and Gebhardt,
J.C.M. (2020). Inferring quantity and qualities of superimposed reaction rates from
single molecule survival time distributions. Scientific Reports, 10(1).

In this paper, the ideas and the mathematics behind the GRID fitting procedure are
explained. This package provides functions to perform the GRID fitting procedure in
Python.
