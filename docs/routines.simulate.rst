Simulation
==========

Here you can find the functions that can be used for the simulation of fluorescence survival time distributions.
To simulate the fluorescence survival time distribution for a single time-lapse condition, see :py:meth:`gridlib.tl_simulation_single`.
To simulate the fluorescence survival time distributions for multiple time-lapse conditions, see :py:meth:`gridlib.tl_simulation`.
