============
Installation
============

It is currently only possible to install GRIDLib through PyPI with the help of pip. We
advise you to install GRIDLib in a virtual environment so the dependencies will not
interfere with the packages in your main Python environment.

Stable release
--------------

To install GRIDLib, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install gridlib

This is the preferred method to install GRIDLib, as it will always install the most
recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide you
through the process.
